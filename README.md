# Advent of Code 2023

The Advent of Code is an annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015. Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days. You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.

These are my solutions for 2023 written in Kotlin. I try to embrace a functional style with minimal use of mutable data, using the Kotlin library constructs to minimize the use of explicit loops, if & when, and local variables.
